This repository contains two ongoing projects exploring Flamingo and BLIP-2-style vision-language models for biomolecular generation. The first focuses on designing proteins for plastic degradation, while the second aims to generate drug-like molecules for cell state modulation. Both projects integrate multimodal learning to advance sequence, structure, and function-based molecular design.
